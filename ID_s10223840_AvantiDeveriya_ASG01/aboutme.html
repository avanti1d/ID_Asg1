        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <p><h3>I am a student that is currently studying ICT in Ngee Ann Polytechnic. I am of Indian descent and moved to Singapore during my early years of childhood. I was always interested in photography from a young age and enrolled in classes along with my father and elder brother. Eventually I started exploring nature as I was more interested in scenic photography. Along with photography my hobbies include, swimming, drama, art and reading.

            Other skills that I know are python, web development(html,css), video and photo editing, sql, microsoft excel, word and powerpoint. I am fluent in both English and Hindi and I am currently learning Japanese. I aspire to learn more languages as I believe that will help me to adapt to different cultures and help me overcome language barriers.
           
            For my education I have done my IGCSE from international schooling in singapore. IGCSE is a Year 10 diploma that is considered 
            equivalent to the O-levels in Singapore. My subjects were ICT, Physics, E Math, Biology, First Language English, English Literature,
           Second Language Hindi and Economics. During my secondary school I was part of the drama club and often performed in school events and was also a part of the photography club.</h3>
