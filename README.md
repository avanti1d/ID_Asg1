# ID ASSIGNMENT 1- Avanti's Portfolio!

This project of mine here is a website called Avanti's portfolio. This website is essentially made to showcase the skills I have. 
The website aswell inquires my experience on photography. Avanti's portfolio requires  some background information about me. 
Stating as the information, I have also included general skills that I think I will prove useful in the area of photography.

Essentially, Avanti's portfolio is a showcase of my abilities as a photographer and my journey as I grow as one. 
It includes a brief background about me and a few skills I have picked up that may prove useful in the area of photography. 
My website contains different sections to engage the user. The users can go through my individual projects and can also send me a message through the contact form that has been
provided in one of the website. I chose the scenery because I like the scenery. 
Life is filled with beautiful things that is yet to discover and that is what I think the purpose of my website is, to show how much more life can be.

# DESIGN PROCESS
This website was made to attract potential employers to consider me as a scenic photographer or in the field of photography in general. 
I wanted to overall give a dark theme as I feel it is more attractive and is also simple but not too cluttered to the human eye.

As a user, I would perform an action to see the website's theme, content, and main projects that showcase the potential employee's work and experience.
I would also like to see a simple contact form so that it is easy and quick to contact the employee. I would also look at wether the content is 
properly shown and it legible and understandable to me.

I created a wireframe for a baseline to follow while making my website. The wireframe is an adobe XD file that can be found in my github repository.

# FEATURES
 Existing features:
 1) Navigation bar in the heading of the website so that the user can access any section of the website from any page
 2) Buttons on each page to take the user to the next sections
 3) Photo gallery for the user to click on each photo and inspect it at a larger scale
 4) A contact me form where the user can send their name, email and message to me

# TECHNOLOGIES USED
1) VS CODE: VS code is the platform where I developed my html and css code and javascript
2) w3schools.org: This is where I took ideas of javascript and css
3) Vimeo: this website helped me take my video recording of my website
4) adobe XD: To develop my wireframe


# TESTING
1. Contact me form:
 - In the beginning none of the sections of the form could take any text written
 - Upon reasearching I was able to get message inputs but the send button will  not take any action
 - After refining it further I was able to get the button to send the message and afterwards take the user back to the homepage upon sending

2. Photo gallery:
- The photo gallery was hard to debug as upon every zoom it would not englarge to the desired effect and was not centered enough
- After research i decided to use javascript to make it more engaging
